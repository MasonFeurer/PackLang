# PackLang
PackLang is a programming language designed to make <a href="https://minecraft.net">Minecraft</a> <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Data_pack">datapack</a> development easier.

## The Language
The documentation for the syntax of the language can be found in `/docs`.
There are plans to create a tutorial on starting with the language and compiler when the language and compiler are more developed.

## The Compiler
The compiler is written in the Rust programming language, and the source code is in `/src`.

### Using
Using the compiler will require compiling the compiler, written in Rust.

If you have `git` and `rustup` installed, you can use these commands to compile and run the compiler:<p>
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/MasonFeurer/PackLang.git"
cd PackLang
cargo run
```

If you are using a Unix-like operating system (MacOS, Linux, etc.), you should already have `git` installed. <p>
